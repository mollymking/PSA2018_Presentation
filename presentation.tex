\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Motivation}

  %Motivation - 3 reasons
  \begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Why care about information inequality?}
    \begin{itemize}
    \note[item]{Most of us are in this room because we try to understand the origins or cures of inequality.}

    \item
      Differences in information capacity itself are, by definition, a
      dimension of `inequality';

        \note[item]{Were also all here because we like learning for the sake of knowledge, so I probably don't have to argue too much for this idea of the inherent value of knowledge.}
        \note[item]{Much like many people care about health or education as goods in and of themselves, not just for the ends they can help achieve, we may also think that knowledge is of value for its own sake.}
    \end{itemize}
  \end{frame}

  %Motivation - 3 reasons
  \begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Why care about information inequality?}
    \begin{itemize}

    \item
    \textcolor{gray}{Differences in information capacity itself are, by definition, a
      dimension of `inequality';}
    \item
      Differences in the amount of information people have are influenced by
      unequal social positions in our society; and

        \note[item]{I argue that a concept I am calling information inequality - or knowledge inequality - is important as both an outcome and cause of social inequality.}

    \end{itemize}
  \end{frame}

  %Motivation - 3 reasons
  \begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Why care about information inequality?}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      \textcolor{gray}{Differences in information capacity itself are, by definition, a
      dimension of `inequality';}
    \item
      \textcolor{gray}{Differences in the amount of information people have are influenced by
      unequal social positions in our society; and}
    \item
      Information is a potential cause of later inequality in outcomes and
      access to resources.

    \note[item]{Finally, information discrepancies enable differential access to resources and institutional positions, thereby causing later inequality as well.}
    \note[item]{So, while I argue that knowledge inequality is important from both ends of the causal arrow, in this research I focus on the idea that social status causes knowledge inequality.}
    \end{itemize}
  \end{frame}


% Research Questions
\subsection{Research Question}
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Research Question}
  \emph{How does the status gap in knowledge vary by domain?}
    \note[item]{The field of sociology has long studied the production of knowledge in science inequalities in knowledge careers; and information diffusion and its consequences. Many studies have evaluated information seeking behaviors and needs. But the tendency has either been to study knowledge in one specific domain (e.g., health) or to reduce knowledge across all domains to a single test score -- and hence we know shockingly little about the everyday knowledge stock of Americans.}
   \note[item]{So I wanted to perform a wide scan analysis of knowledge inequality, looking at who has and does not have knowledge in different domains, and how those inequalities might compare to each other.}

\note[item]{My data include 48 nationally representative data sets from between the
years 2005 and 2015, each including at least one knowledge question.}
 \note[item]{I collected these data from places like main public opinion survey repositories, the
General Social Survey and Pew Research Center.}
\note[item]{A question was included if it asked respondents about factual knowledge  - a question with a generally agreed-upon answer}
\note[item]{These are true/false or multiple-choice questions that asked things like:}
  \note[item]{--- ``True or false: A laser is a concentrated soundwave. The answer is false - lasers are concentrated light waves.''}
  \note[item]{--- ``Who is the vice president?''}

\note[item]{I also gathered many demographic characteristics about the individuals answering these factual knowledge questions.}
\note[item]{For each question, I then use logistic regression to predict the probability that an individual will get the question correct.}
\end{frame}




\section{Results}
\subsection{Means across domains}
\subsection{Proportions correct by group}



 % Cross-domain gender log odds
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{No mean gender difference in 5/16 domains}
  \begin{figure}[ht]
    \begin{center}
      \includegraphics[height=3in]{"/Users/mollymking/Documents/SocResearch/Dissertation/results/figures/08_vis/ki08_vis06_graphCIs_all-gender"}
    \end{center}
  \end{figure}

  \note[item]{Here again, I tested whether gender had a significant effect on knowledge within each entire domain. For each domain, the simulated mean and confidence intervals allow us to see whether there is a significant difference between the 2 gender groups and the direction of that difference.}
  \note[item]{While there is no average gender difference in 5 of the 16 domains, men have greater average knowledge in 10 domains.}
  \note[item]{Women have greater average knowledge in the domain of social science.}
  \note[item]{One interesting difference I would like to focus your attention on is that men have greater average knowledge than women in the domain of religion. This is a surprising result given that U.S. women are much more likely to report that religion is ``very important'' in their lives, and women are largely responsible for the religious education of children.}
\end{frame}


% Proportion of questions above and below 0 log odds by gender
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Men answer greater proportion of questions correctly in 65\% of domains}
  \begin{figure}[ht]
    \begin{center}
      \includegraphics[height=3in]{"/Users/mollymking/Documents/SocResearch/Dissertation/results/figures/08_vis/ki08_vis03_propHoriz02_multComp_gender"}
    \end{center}
  \end{figure}

  \note[item]{Men answer a greater proportion of questions correctly in 65\% of the domains, while women answer a greater proportion of questions correctly in 12.5\% of the domains.}
  \note[item]{We see that women answer greater proportion questions correctly in the domains of health and social science.}
  \note[item]{Men are particularly advantaged in the domains of finance, physical science, foreign politics, geography, and war - though the last may be an artifact of sample size}
\end{frame}

% Log odds for correct answer by class and knowledge domain
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Income correlates with mean knowledge advantage in 13/14 domains}
  \begin{figure}[ht]
    \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[height=3in]{"/Users/mollymking/Documents/SocResearch/Dissertation/results/figures/08_vis/ki08_vis06_graphCIs_all-income"}
    \end{center}
  \end{figure}

  \note[item]{Here we see this model using income to predict the likelihood that respondents get the factual knowledge question correct, controlling for all other factors. }
  \note[item]{As a reminder, this is after controlling for education - making this a conservative test for the effect of income (since in effect we are controlling twice for class).}
  \note[item]{So in this slide, I tested whether the effect of income on the average knowledge in the whole domain was significant. For each domain, we decide whether there is a significant effect of income, and then see that that effect largely favors those with higher incomes having more knowledge.}
\end{frame}


% Proportion of questions above and below 0 log odds by income
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Those with higher incomes answer a greater proportion of questions correctly}
  \begin{figure}[ht]
    \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[height=3in]{"/Users/mollymking/Documents/SocResearch/Dissertation/results/figures/08_vis/ki08_vis03_propHoriz02_multComp_income"}
    \end{center}
  \end{figure}

  \note[item]{We can also look at whether each question within a given domain was significantly different.}
  \note[item]{This way of viewing the data shows us that those with higher incomes answer a greater proportion of questions correctly in half of the domains.}
  \note[item]{Those with higher incomes are particularly advantaged in the domains of health, finance, and social science.}

   \note[item]{Findings are consistent with the model that implies:}
      \note[item]{--- demographic characteristics affect the knowledge an individual has, and}
      \note[item]{--- using knowledge to access resources.}
   \note[item]{Understanding the broad demographic patterns can help us move toward better understanding of the mechanisms behind them.}

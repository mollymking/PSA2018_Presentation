% To give a presentation with the Skim reader (http://skim-app.sourceforge.net) on OSX so
% that you see the notes on your laptop and the slides on the projector, do the following:
%
% 1. Generate just the presentation (hide notes) and save to slides.
% \setbeameroption{hide notes} % Only slides
% 2. Generate only the notes (show only nodes) and save to notes.pdf
 % \setbeameroption{show only notes} % Only notes

% 3. With Skim open both slides.pdf and notes.pdf
% 4. Click on slides.pdf to bring it to front.
% 5. In Skim, under "View -> Presentation Option -> Synhcronized Noted Document"
%    select notes.pdf.
% 6. Now as you move around in slides.pdf the notes.pdf file will follow you.
% 7. Arrange windows so that notes.pdf is in full screen mode on your laptop

\section{Introduction}

%Motivation - 3 reasons
\subsection{Motivation}
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Why care about information inequality?}
  \begin{itemize}
  \note[item]{Most of us are in this room because we try to understand the origins or cures of inequality.}

  \item
    Differences in information capacity itself are, by definition, a
    dimension of `inequality';
      \note[item]{Were also all here because we like learning for the sake of knowledge, so I probably don't have to argue too much for this idea of the inherent value of knowledge.}
  \pause
  \item
    Differences in the amount of information people have are influenced by
    unequal social positions in our society; and
      \note[item]{I argue that a concept I am calling information inequality - or knowledge inequality - is important as both an outcome and cause of social inequality.}
  \pause
  \item
    Information is a potential cause of later inequality in outcomes and
    access to resources.

  \note[item]{So, while I argue that knowledge inequality is important from both ends of the causal argument, in this research I focus on the idea that social status causes knowledge inequality.}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}


% Research Questions
\subsection{Research Question}
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Research Question}
  \emph{How does the status gap in knowledge vary by domain?}
    \note[item]{The field of sociology has long studied the production of knowledge in science inequalities in knowledge careers; and information diffusion and its consequences. Many studies have evaluated information seeking behaviors and needs. But the tendency has either been to study knowledge in one specific domain (e.g., health) or to reduce knowledge across all domains to a single test score -- and hence we know shockingly little about the everyday knowledge stock of Americans.}
   \note[item]{So I wanted to perform a wide scan analysis of knowledge inequality, looking at who has and does not have knowledge in different domains, and how those inequalities might compare to each other.}

\note[item]{My data include 48 nationally representative data sets from between the
years 2005 and 2015, each including at least one knowledge question.}
 \note[item]{I collected these data from places like main public opinion survey repositories, the
General Social Survey and Pew Research Center.}
\note[item]{A question was included if it asked respondents about factual knowledge  - a question with a generally agreed-upon answer}
\note[item]{These are true/false or multiple-choice questions that asked things like:}
  \note[item]{--- ``True or false: A laser is a concentrated soundwave. The answer is false - lasers are concentrated light waves.''}
  \note[item]{--- ``Who is the vice president?''}

\note[item]{I also gathered many demographic characteristics about the individuals answering these factual knowledge questions.}
\note[item]{For each question, I then use logistic regression to predict the probability that an individual will get the question correct.}

\section{Results}
\subsection{Means across domains}
\subsection{Proportions correct by group}

% Log odds for correct answer by class and knowledge domain
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Income correlates with mean knowledge advantage in 13/14 domains}
  \begin{figure}[ht]
    \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[height=3in]{"/Users/mollymking/Documents/SocResearch/Dissertation/results/figures/08_vis/ki08_vis06_graphCIs_all-income"}
    \end{center}
  \end{figure}

  \note[item]{}
  \note[item]{As a reminder, this is after controlling for education - making this a conservative test for the effect of income (since in effect we are controlling twice for class).}
  \note[item]{So in this slide, I tested whether the effect of income on the average knowledge in the whole domain with significant. For each domain, we decide whether there is a significant effect of income, and then see that that effect largely favors those with higher incomes having more knowledge.}
\end{frame}


% Proportion of questions above and below 0 log odds by income
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Those with higher incomes answer a greater proportion of questions correctly}
  \begin{figure}[ht]
    \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[height=3in]{"/Users/mollymking/Documents/SocResearch/Dissertation/results/figures/08_vis/ki08_vis03_propHoriz02_multComp_income"}
    \end{center}
  \end{figure}

  \note[item]{We can also look at whether each question within a given domain was significantly different.}
\end{frame}


 % Cross-domain gender log odds
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{No mean gender difference in 5/16 domains}
  \begin{figure}[ht]
    \begin{center}
      \includegraphics[height=3in]{"/Users/mollymking/Documents/SocResearch/Dissertation/results/figures/08_vis/ki08_vis06_graphCIs_all-gender"}
    \end{center}
  \end{figure}

  \note[item]{Here again, I tested whether gender had a significant effect on knowledge within each entire domain. For each domain, the simulated mean and confidence intervals allow us to see whether there is a significant difference between the 2 gender groups and the direction of that difference.}
\end{frame}


% Proportion of questions above and below 0 log odds by gender
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Men answer greater proportion of questions correctly in 65\% of domains}
  \begin{figure}[ht]
    \begin{center}
      \includegraphics[height=3in]{"/Users/mollymking/Documents/SocResearch/Dissertation/results/figures/08_vis/ki08_vis03_propHoriz02_multComp_gender"}

   \note[item]{Findings are consistent with the model that implies:}
      \note[item]{--- demographic characteristics affect the knowledge an individual has, and}
      \note[item]{--- using knowledge to access resources.}
   \note[item]{Understanding the broad demographic patterns can help us move toward better understanding of the mechanisms behind them.}

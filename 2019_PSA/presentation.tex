    \note[item]{Good morning, everyone! Thank you for being here.}
    \note[item]{My name is Molly King.}
    \note[item]{I am a PhD candidate at Stanford University}
    \note[item]{Today I am going to be presenting on 1 of the papers from my dissertation about gender disparities in factual knowledge.}
    \note[item]{I will be exploring these gaps using analyses of quantitative survey data.}
    \note[item]{I will show that women's disadvantage in most areas of factual knowledge closely follows patterns of social norms, suggesting the power of socialization and gendered expectation in creating knowledge inequalities.}
   \note[item]{I will discuss how this reflects what knowledge is valued in our society and sheds light on important sites of the reproduction of inequality.}

   \note[item]{Never before has such a wealth of information been so
   immediately accessible to so many and yet the filtering
   demands so high.  Topics many believe to be objective and
   resolved after years of scientific consensus are now resurfacing as topics
   of factual debate. What people know, what we think we know, and what we
   think others know all have dramatic consequences for the future of the U.S.
   and the world. Information truly is power; and who possesses it and wields
   it most effectively has profound consequences for inequality and human
   welfare.}
   \note[item]{People disagree about facts, and this is shaping our public narrative more than ever.}
   \note[item]{But not only are we dealing with disagreements about facts. People also have differential access to the facts.}

  \note[item]{Epistemology commonly distinguishes between three types of
  knowledge:}
    \note[item]{The category of ``knowledge-that'' is what interests me here.}
    \note[item]{Knowledge-that can roughly be thought of as declarative
    knowledge, propositional knowledge, or ``explicit knowledge of a fact.''}
    \note[item]{My study focuses on inequalities in this type of knowledge.}

  % %Motivation - 3 reasons
  % \begin{frame}
  % \frametitle{Why care about information inequality?}
  %   \begin{itemize}
  %   \note[item]{Most of us are in this room because we try to understand the origins or cures of inequality in some form.}
  %
  %   \item
  %     Differences in information capacity itself are, by definition, a
  %     dimension of `inequality';
  %
  %       \note[item]{Were also all here because we believe in the importance of knowledge, so I probably don't have to argue too much for this idea of the inherent value of knowledge.}
  %       \note[item]{Here I want to note that I do NOT mean to equate knowledge or information capacity with intelligence. Knowledge of facts is only one aspect of knowledge, after all, and IQ measures something more akin to analytic abilities.}
  %       \note[item]{Much like many people care about health or education as goods in and of themselves, not just for the ends they can help achieve, we may also think that knowledge is of value for its own sake.}

  % %Motivation - 3 reasons
  % \begin{frame}
  % \frametitle{Why care about information inequality?}
  %   \begin{itemize}
  %
  %   \item
  %   \textcolor{gray}{Differences in information capacity itself are, by definition, a
  %     dimension of `inequality';}
  %   \item
  %     Differences in the amount of information people have are influenced by
  %     unequal social positions in our society;
  %
  %       \note[item]{I argue that a concept I am calling information inequality - or knowledge inequality - is important as both an outcome and cause of social inequality.}
  %
  %
  %   \end{itemize}

  % %Motivation - 3 reasons
  % \begin{frame}
  % \frametitle{Why care about information inequality?}
  %   \begin{itemize}
  %   \item
  %     \textcolor{gray}{Differences in information capacity itself are, by definition, a
  %     dimension of `inequality';}
  %   \item
  %     \textcolor{gray}{Differences in the amount of information people have are influenced by
  %     unequal social positions in our society; and}
  %   \item
  %     Information is a potential cause of later inequality in outcomes and
  %     access to resources.
  %
  %   \note[item]{Finally, information discrepancies enable differential access to resources and institutional positions, thereby causing later inequality as well.}
  %   \note[item]{So, while I argue that knowledge inequality is important from both ends of the causal arrow, in this research I focus on the idea that social status causes knowledge inequality.}
  %
  %       \note[item]{The field of sociology has long studied the production of knowledge in science inequalities in knowledge careers; and information diffusion and its consequences. Many studies have evaluated information seeking behaviors and needs. But the tendency has either been to study knowledge in one specific domain (e.g., health) or to reduce knowledge across all domains to a single test score -- and hence we know shockingly little about the everyday knowledge stock of Americans.}

  \vspace{.2cm}
  \emph{Does the gender gap in knowledge vary by domain?} \\
  \vspace{.2cm}
  \emph{What social process(es) explain(s) this gap?}

  \note[item]{So I wanted to perform a wide scan analysis of knowledge inequality, first finding out the answer to the most fundamental question: is there a gender gap in knowledge in different domains?}
  \note[item]{Then I wanted to look at who has and does not have knowledge in different domains, and how those inequalities might compare to each other.}
  \note[item]{I also sought to explore what social processes might explain the variance in knowledge by domain.}

    \end{tabular}
   \end{columns}

  \note[item]{in order to explore these questions, I collected data from 48
  nationally representative data sets from between the years 2005 and 2015, each
  including at least one knowledge question.}
  \note[item]{I collected over 500 questions data from main public opinion
  survey repositories, like the General Social Survey, Pew Research Center, and ICPSR.}
  \note[item]{A question was included if it asked respondents about factual
  knowledge  - a question with a generally agreed-upon answer.}
  \note[item]{These are true/false or multiple-choice questions that asked
  things like:}
  \note[item]{-``Chest pain is a symptom that
  someone may be having a heart attack -- true or false.}

  \end{columns}

  \note[item]{For each question, I marked for each individual whether they got the question correct or incorrect.}
  \note[item]{I curated these data and categorized them by domain.}
  \note[item]{This resulted in 16 topical domains.}
  \note[item]{People have studied knowledge gaps in many of these domains
  before. What is unique to my study is gathering these domains all together in
  one comparative framework, allowing me to look at the structured acquisition
  of knowledge.}

      \hline  % adds horizontal line to the bottom edges
      \end{tabular}
\end{columns}

  \note[item]{So that's what's here. It's also interesting to reflect on what is not here.}
  \note[item]{Across all of the surveys between 2005 and 2015, I was unable to find any questions related to facts about child development or elder care, household maintenance, cleaning, cooking, car maintenance, or art or music.}
  \note[item]{While many of these might be considered more skills based domains, there are also ways to ask questions about them that are more factually grounded.}
  \note[item]{Even if items around this type of knowledge are being included in nationally representative surveys, they are not being framed as knowledge.}
  \note[item]{The fact that these domains are missing is important commentary on what knowledge our culture considers important, a point I will return to in my hypotheses.}

  \note[item]{This possibility leads me to my first hypothesis: the question maker bias hypothesis.}
  \note[item]{Under this hypothesis, questions in all domains are biased to be
  more likely to be answered correctly by men - or to be answered by men at all
  - because they are more likely to be written by men in the first place.}
  \note[item]{This is indicated here with predicted log odds in favor of men
  knowing more. The log odds of a woman knowing the correct answer relative to a
  man is presented along the y axis. Under this hypothesis, men would be

  these gendered ratings of the questions themselves. So the respondents'
  performance on the knowledge items and the ratings of how gendered each item is
  perceived to be are as independent as possible.}
  \note[item]{This is strong evidence that gendered socialization mechanisms are
  at work here in determining the domains of knowledge men and women specialize
  in.}

  expectations and socialization shape the knowledge acquired by men and women,

  \note[item]{\scriptsize{Weber's three interrelated bases for inequalities in modern
  industrial societies are resources, power and status. Status differences
  between individuals may be created by virtue of information differences.
  Social status is defined as inequality grounded in differences in respect,
  esteem, and honor. ``People use culture to make connections with one
  another''; information that is important to one's social contacts may lead
  those important others to publicly acknowledge that person and contribute to
  their sense of being valued. When aggregated at the group level, this control
  of information may be ``transformed into more essentialized differences among
  `types' of people, status beliefs that fuel social perceptions of
  difference.'' At the macro-level, I argue these differences in information,
  originally created on the basis of gender, give a force to status beliefs that
  can reproduce material inequalities independent of initial differences in
  power or resources.}}

  \note[item]{A number of different mechanisms may be at work behind this
  finding of gender essentialism in knowledge.}
  \note[item]{Notably, as adults, gender and class structure lives
  differently. Men and people of the middle and upper classes have more time
  for leisure, and we might imagine that leisure time is one of the key
  times when adults acquire facts about non-occupational related domains.}
  % Men and women experience a gap in leisure time in which men
  % might have the opportunity to learn more knowledge.
  \note[item]{Depending on family
  structure, women have 3 to 5 fewer hours of leisure time per week than men.}
  \note[item]{This is in part due to different social roles and
  expectations, which may have an independent effect on knowledge gaps by
  funneling women and men toward specialized knowledge consistent with these
  duties and norms. Furthermore, ideas about what are socially acceptable and
  desirable interests for men and women in the United States may shape pursuit of
  knowledge in different domains. }

  \note[item]{Related, men and women are socialized differently from a very early age.}
  \note[item]{Children are socialized in gendered ways.}
  \note[item]{Additionally, gender and class differences in
  college major and occupation choice funnel individuals into different streams
  of knowledge exposure, which leads to reinforcing cycles of knowledge gaps and
  the resulting resources.}
  \note[item]{Gender differences in college major may be a
  result of self-expressive career choices, and occupational sorting may further
  reinforce knowledge differences throughout the life course. }
  \note[item]{After college, expectations of discrimination shape entry into
  jobs. Hostile environments in training and everyday discrimination in the
  workplace provide the structural underpinnings for demographic differences in
  knowledge.}

  \note[item]{Finally, while men's and women's networks are similar until they
  have children, they diverge dramatically thereafter. Social networks are
  important source of all types of information - from information about jobs to
  skill sharing - so there is no reason to believe that men and women would not be
  receiving different types of factual information through their networks as well.}
  \note[item]{Gender-segregated networks may also be an important vehicle for maintaining prior socialization.}

  occupations in who gets credit for the production of NEW knowledge in a
  different set of projects, by looking at the effect of gender on author order
  and self citation practices in academic publishing. I would be happy to talk

  \note[item]{My next projects will explore these potential mechanisms in more detail...}
  \note[item]{One project I have planned will investigate whether gender performance
  (or ``doing gender'') contributes to knowledge gaps. Using a subset of my
  data where I can control for occupation, I will explore whether men and women in
  the same occupation differ in their knowledge of different domains. For example, do men in majority-female occupations use knowledge as a way to compensate and assert their masculinity, or do they adapt by acquiring gendered knowledge? I will compare these hypotheses and occupational-specific knowledge hypotheses with a null hypothesis of increasing gender equality over time. This will provide one test of possible theoretical mechanisms underlying the gender gap in knowledge among different domains.}

  \note[item]{Then, within each knowledge domain, I line these resampled simulated coefficients up in order and use the 2.5th percentile and the 97.5th percentile as my upper and lower confidence bounds for that particular knowledge domain. These values are the lower and upper bounds of

\note[item]{shows members of self-citations grouped by proportions of men’s and women’s authorships. We show the proportion of men with a certain number of self-citations on the x-axis and the corresponding proportion of women on the y-axis. If men and woman behaved similarly in their approaches to self-citation, the corners of the boxes would trace the x-y diagonal. Instead, wherever there is a difference in the proportion of men and women citing themselves a certain number of times, the corners of the boxes deviate from the diagonal.}
\note[item]{ relative to men’s authorships, women’s authorships are more likely to feature zero self-citations. Women cite themselves one or more times in their papers less often than men do. In other words, compared with men, women are overrepresented in the zero self-citations category and underrepresented in terms of citing their papers at all. For example, if in a paper you never cite another paper of your own, you are among the majority of men (68.6 percent) and women (78.8 percent) who do not cite themselves.}
\note[item]{whenever a box is wider than it is tall, there is a greater proportion of men authorships in that category of self-citations. If you have one self-citation, you are in the 68th to 88th percentile range for men (representing 20 percent of men’s authorships) but the 78th to 93rd percentile for women (representing only 15 percent of women’s authorships). With four self-citations in a single paper, a woman is in the 99th percentile, while a man is in the 98th.}

A value of 1.5 means that men cite themselves 50 percent more than women in papers published during that year. Shaded intervals represent 95 percent bootstrap confidence limits.}
\note[item]{ In the 1950s, the relative rate15 of men’s self-citations relative to women’s self-citations was 1.23. However, during the 1950s, the bootstrapped 95 percent confidence intervals of the annual ratios overlap with an equality ratio of 1.0, indicating that we cannot reject the null hypothesis of gender equality in self-citation rate during this decade. However, beginning in the 1960s, the ratio of men’s to women’s self-citations per authorship remains steadily significantly above 1.0. In the 2000s, the relative rate was 1.71. There is no evidence that that the gender gap is decreasing over time.}

 % WAYS TO PIVOT
 % Thank you for the question. /  that's a great question
 % More generally how i've been thinking about issues such as this ...

% Q: Why didn't you look at x variable?
  % A: As you might imagine, these data took years to compile, and clean into 1 compatible data set. I think that any good science starts with thorough, careful description. If I were to explore any other variable and my descriptive analyses, I would have to balance with the reduction in what types of knowledge I could look at, since not all data sets have all independent variables that might be of interest. So, if I selected out some trait, I would lose some of my 500 variables that I worked hard aggregate. But I have invested the time in this because I will be able to work with these data for years to come - including analyzing many other interesting independent variables like X.
 % --> add slide with demonstration of how eg, region or/and political affiliation would reduce # variables


 % Q:Haven’t lots of people studied knowledge and equality?
 % A:  Thank you for raising that question. Indeed at first glance it might seem that my topic has been covered by scholars working in areas like health inequality and educational inequality. However, I would suggest that what my work contributes is really a broad comparative view of all types of knowledge inequality - enabling us to look at different types of knowledge in comparative perspective.


 % How does stereotype threat play into this story? It struck me that many of these domains are associated with these status characteristics, so how might stereotype threat affect whether the respondents get the answer right in the first place?

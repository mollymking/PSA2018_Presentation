    \note[item]{Good afternoon, everyone! Thank you for being here.}
    \note[item]{My name is Molly King.}
    \note[item]{I am an Assistant Professor at Santa Clara University}
    \note[item]{Today I am going to be presenting a paper on gender disparities in factual knowledge.}
    \note[item]{I will be exploring these gaps using analyses of quantitative survey data.}
    \note[item]{I will show that women's disadvantage in most areas of factual knowledge closely follows patterns of social norms, suggesting the power of socialization and gendered expectation in creating knowledge inequalities.}
   \note[item]{I will discuss how this reflects what knowledge is valued in our society and sheds light on important sites of the reproduction of inequality.}

   \note[item]{Never before has such a wealth of information been so
   immediately accessible to so many and yet the filtering
   demands so high.  Topics many believe to be objective and
   resolved after years of scientific consensus are now resurfacing as topics
   of factual debate. What people know, what we think we know, and what we
   think others know all have dramatic consequences for the future of the U.S.
   and the world. Information truly is power; and who possesses it and wields
   it most effectively has profound consequences for inequality and human
   welfare.}
   \note[item]{People disagree about facts, and this is shaping our public narrative more than ever.}
   \note[item]{But not only are we dealing with disagreements about facts. People also have differential access to the facts.}

    \note[item]{Epistemology commonly distinguishes between three types of
    knowledge:}
    \note[item]{-- knowledge of a person, or relational knowledge;}
    \note[item]{-- knowledge of how to do something, or skills-based knowledge;}
    \note[item]{-- and  knowledge that some fact is true.}
    \note[item]{The category of factual knowledge, or ``knowledge-that'', is what interests me here.}
    \note[]{So why should we care about inequalities in this?}
\end{frame}


%-------------------------
\subsection{Motivation}

%Motivation - reason 1
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Why care about knowledge inequality?}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    A virtue in itself
  \end{itemize}
  \vspace{1.3 cm}
  \begin{flushright}
    \emph{\scriptsize{\textcolor{gray}{(Crisp 2015)}}}
  \end{flushright}
  \note[item]{First, I argue that differences in information itself are, by definition, a
  dimension of `inequality.'}
  \note[item]{Much like many people care about health or education as goods in
  and of themselves, not just for the ends they can help achieve, we may also
  think that knowledge is of value for its own sake, or for its ability to help live the good life.}
  \note[item]{Here I want to note that I do NOT mean to equate knowledge
   with intelligence. Knowledge of facts is only one aspect
  of knowledge, after all, and IQ measures something more akin to analytic
  abilities.}
\end{frame}


%Motivation - reason 2
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Why care about knowledge inequality?}
\vspace{1 cm}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    \textcolor{gray}{A virtue in itself}
  \item
    Access to resources, outcomes, capabilities
  \end{itemize}
  \vspace{0.83 cm}
  \begin{flushright}
    \emph{\scriptsize{\textcolor{gray}{(Weber [1922]1968, DiMaggio 1987, Ridgeway 2014,\\ Lareau 2002, Lareau 2003, Sen 1992, Nussbaum 2011)}}}
  \end{flushright}
  \note[item]{Second, information is a potential cause of later inequality in outcomes, resources, and capabilities.}
  \note[item]{Information discrepancies enable differential access
  to resources and institutional positions, thereby causing later inequality as
  well.}
  \note[item]{Furthermore, people need not only skills to navigate
  bureaucracies in order to get access to resources - they also need concrete
  knowledge about the types of resources they are trying to access.}
\end{frame}


%Motivation - reason 3
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Why care about knowledge inequality?}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    \textcolor{gray}{A virtue in itself}
  \item
    \textcolor{gray}{Access to resources, outcomes, capabilities}
  \item
    Outcome of unequal social status
  \end{itemize}

  \note[item]{Finally, I argue that a concept I am calling knowledge
  inequality is important as an outcome of social inequality.}
  \note[item]{In my dissertation, I focus on this motivation -- that social
  status causes knowledge inequality.}

  \note[item]{The field of sociology has long studied the production of knowledge; science inequalities in knowledge careers; and information diffusion and its consequences. Many studies have evaluated information seeking behaviors and needs. But the tendency has either been to study knowledge in one specific domain (e.g., health) or to reduce knowledge across all domains to a single test score -- and hence we know shockingly little about the everyday knowledge stock of Americans.}

\frametitle{Research Questions}
  \emph{Is there a gender gap in knowledge?} \\
  \vspace{.2cm}
  \emph{Does the gender gap in knowledge vary by domain?} \\
  \vspace{.2cm}
  \emph{What social process(es) explain(s) this gap?}

  \note[item]{So I wanted to perform a wide scan analysis of knowledge inequality, first finding out the answer to the most fundamental question: is there a gender gap in knowledge in different domains?}
  \note[item]{Then I wanted to look at who has and does not have knowledge in different domains, and how those inequalities might compare to each other.}
  \note[item]{I also sought to explore what social processes might explain the variance in knowledge by domain.}

        Total & 48  & 513 \\
        \hline
      \end{tabular}
   \end{columns}

  \note[item]{in order to explore these questions, I collected data from 48
  nationally representative data sets from between the years 2005 and 2015, each
  including at least one knowledge question.}
  \note[item]{I collected over 500 questions from public survey
  repositories, like the General Social Survey, Pew Research Center, and ICPSR.}
  \note[item]{These are true/false, yes/no, or multiple-choice questions
  that asked things like: `Antibiotics kill viruses as well as bacteria. Is that
  true or false?'' The answer is false.}
  \note[item]{I am happy to talk more about my data or methods in Q \& A if anyone is interested.}

  \note[item]{For each question, I marked for each individual whether they got the question correct or incorrect.}
  \note[item]{I curated these data and categorized them by domain.}
  \note[item]{This resulted in 16 topical domains.}
  \note[item]{Now of course, people have studied knowledge gaps in many of these domains
  before. What is unique to my study is gathering these domains all together in
  one comparative framework, allowing me to look at the structured acquisition
  of knowledge.}

%   \note[item]{So that's what's here. It's also interesting to reflect on what is not here.}
%   \note[item]{Across all of the surveys between 2005 and 2015, I was unable to find any questions related to facts about child development or elder care, household maintenance, cleaning, cooking, car maintenance, or art or music.}
%   \note[item]{While many of these might be considered more skills based domains, there are also ways to ask questions about them that are more factually grounded.}
%   \note[item]{Even if items around this type of knowledge are being included in nationally representative surveys, they are not being framed as knowledge.}
%   \note[item]{The fact that these domains are missing is important commentary on what knowledge our culture considers important, a point I will return to in my hypotheses.}

%   \item
%     Socialized Essentialism
% \end{itemize}
%   \note[item]{My data can help look for evidence in support of two theories, which I call the question-maker-bias and the Socialized Essentialism hypotheses.}
%   \note[item]{\footnotesize{Both ask: what might explain any gender variation in knowledge amongst domains?}}
% \end{frame}


\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Hypothesis: Question Maker Bias}

  \emph{\scriptsize{\textcolor{gray}{(Photo credit: Wellcome Images)}}}
\end{flushleft}
  \note[item]{I first consider how the questions themselves are produced.}
  \note[item]{In a way, ``everything is information'', so it can be very
  difficult to narrow what should be put into surveys to assess the knowledge
  base of the populace.}
  \note[item]{Politics, power, professions, personal relationships,
  and historical contingency all play a role in determining which knowledge items
  warrant special rewards from society. Some of this bias will inevitably creep
  into surveys.}
  \note[item]{Even though current advisory boards are much more
  gender balanced than my image here, many of the items still being asked are
  holdovers from an earlier time.}
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Hypothesis: Question Maker Bias}

  \end{center}
\end{figure}
  \note[item]{This leads me to my first hypothesis: the question maker bias hypothesis.}
  \note[item]{Under this, questions in all domains are biased to be
  more likely to be answered correctly by men - or to be answered by men at all
  - because they are more likely to be written by men in the first place.}
  \note[item]{This is indicated here with predicted log odds in favor of men
  knowing more. The log odds of a woman knowing the correct answer relative to a
  man is presented along the y axis. Under this hypothesis, men would be
  expected to know more in all domains.}
  \note[item]{In other words, if the squares are under the line, men would know
  more; if they are above the line, women would know more. This is the first
  hypothesis.}
\end{frame}

\frametitle{Hypothesis: Socialized Essentialism}

  \note[item]{Alternatively, socialization may cause specialized knowledge by
  gender.}
  \note[item]{Gender may have a direct impact on the types of knowledge
  acquired via education, occupations, and social networks.}
  \note[item]{Gender may also have an indirect impact via social norms, gaps in
  leisure time, or other socially shaped expectations of gendered knowledge
  interests.}

  \end{figure}
  \note[item]{These interrelated mechanisms lead me to the Socialized
  Essentialism hypothesis.}
  \note[item]{Under this hypothesis, men and women specialize in knowledge
  domains.}
  \note[item]{But how do we know what gendered specialization in knowledge look like?}
  \note[item]{My estimates for the relative specialization of men and women
  in different domains in this hypothesis come from a survey I fielded asking
  about respondents' perceptions of each knowledge question.}
  \note[item]{I don't have time to discuss the details of this survey here, but I am happy to talk more about it in Q\&A.}

  \note[item]{Revisiting my original theory, I found my results do not match the question maker bias hypothesis.}
  \note[item]{I find my results do closely match the socialized essentialism hypothesis.}
  \note[item]{Remember, the socialized essentialism hypothesis -- represented here by red open squares -- predicts that the
  respondents on the nationally representative surveys with the factual
  knowledge questions will perform in correlation to the gender each item is
  perceived to be. In other words, women answer more questions incorrectly in
  those domains that are perceived to be more ``masculine,'' and vice versa.}
  \note[item]{I do find high
  degree of correlation between what people think women and men are likely to
  know more about and the actual factual knowledge respondents report on
  nationally representative surveys.}
  \note[item]{Remember, my classifications into domains had nothing to do with
  these gendered ratings of the questions themselves. So the respondents'
  performance on the knowledge items and the ratings of how gendered each item is
  perceived to be are as independent as possible.}
  \note[item]{This is strong evidence that gendered socialization mechanisms are
  at work here in determining the domains of knowledge men and women specialize
  in.}
  \note[item]{In this way, our expectations shape our reality. Social
  expectations and socialization shape the knowledge acquired by men and women,
  with dramatic consequences for inequality. I'm happy to talk more about possible mechanisms for this in the Q \& A.}
  \note[item]{The socially structured acquisition of knowledge leads to
  stratified gaps in information resources, but it also leads to different value
  placed on different types of knowledge.}

  \note[item]{\scriptsize{Weber's three interrelated bases for inequalities in modern
  industrial societies are resources, power and status. Status differences
  between individuals may be created by virtue of information differences.
  Social status is defined as inequality grounded in differences in respect,
  esteem, and honor. ``People use culture to make connections with one
  another''; information that is important to one's social contacts may lead
  those important others to publicly acknowledge that person and contribute to
  their sense of being valued. When aggregated at the group level, this control
  of information may be ``transformed into more essentialized differences among
  `types' of people, status beliefs that fuel social perceptions of
  difference.'' At the macro-level, I argue these differences in information,
  originally created on the basis of gender, give a force to status beliefs that
  can reproduce material inequalities independent of initial differences in
  power or resources.}}

  \note[item]{Note here how in the natural world domain women have .8 odds smaller of knowing the correct answer in the domain, on average.}
  \note[item]{But this first figure does not indicate how many of these questions
  show knowledge differences that are statistically significant.}
  \note[item]{So for each of these 500 questions, I tested whether the gender difference in knowledge was significant.}
   % Also wondering whether you can get the bars for men and women on the same line for each domain on the second graph. It's a little hard to tell now which bars belong to which domain.

  \end{figure}
  \note[item]{However, not all of those coefficients are statistically
  significant. In this figure, each bar represents the proportion of all questions in a given domain that men or women were more likely to answer correctly such that these differences were statistically significant.}
  \note[item]{So in the example of the natural world, the average gap between men and women across all items in the natural world domain is significantly different from 0, but there was no single question where men or women were more likely to be correct.}
  \note[item]{This can also go the other way, in theory, where the average gap is not significantly different from 0 but individual questions are. Though there are no examples of this here, social science does come close.}
  \note[item]{I also find that women answer a greater proportion of questions
  correctly in the domain of health, though this is a bit more complicated. Both men and women have some questions that they are significantly more likely than the other group to answer correctly, so there are proportions in both directions on the graph.}
  \note[item]{One reason we might consider this to be notable is that men's poor
  health outcomes are typically explained by behavioral differences. Here,
  differences in health outcomes might also be explained by a disparity in health knowledge.}
  \note[item]{You might assume this is driven by gender differences and education.}

  politics, and geography.}
  \note[item]{Overall, Men answer a greater proportion of
  questions statistically significantly correctly in 3/5ths of the domains. Women
  answer a greater proportion of questions correctly in 1/5th of the domains.}

\note[item]{shows members of self-citations grouped by proportions of men’s and women’s authorships. We show the proportion of men with a certain number of self-citations on the x-axis and the corresponding proportion of women on the y-axis. If men and woman behaved similarly in their approaches to self-citation, the corners of the boxes would trace the x-y diagonal. Instead, wherever there is a difference in the proportion of men and women citing themselves a certain number of times, the corners of the boxes deviate from the diagonal.}
\note[item]{ relative to men’s authorships, women’s authorships are more likely to feature zero self-citations. Women cite themselves one or more times in their papers less often than men do. In other words, compared with men, women are overrepresented in the zero self-citations category and underrepresented in terms of citing their papers at all. For example, if in a paper you never cite another paper of your own, you are among the majority of men (68.6 percent) and women (78.8 percent) who do not cite themselves.}
\note[item]{whenever a box is wider than it is tall, there is a greater proportion of men authorships in that category of self-citations. If you have one self-citation, you are in the 68th to 88th percentile range for men (representing 20 percent of men’s authorships) but the 78th to 93rd percentile for women (representing only 15 percent of women’s authorships). With four self-citations in a single paper, a woman is in the 99th percentile, while a man is in the 98th.}

\note[item]{shows the self-citation ratio for each year. If men and women cited themselves at equal rates, the ratio shown would be 1.0. A value of 1.5 means that men cite themselves 50 percent more than women in papers published during that year. Shaded intervals represent 95 percent bootstrap confidence limits.}
\note[item]{ In the 1950s, the relative rate15 of men’s self-citations relative to women’s self-citations was 1.23. However, during the 1950s, the bootstrapped 95 percent confidence intervals of the annual ratios overlap with an equality ratio of 1.0, indicating that we cannot reject the null hypothesis of gender equality in self-citation rate during this decade. However, beginning in the 1960s, the ratio of men’s to women’s self-citations per authorship remains steadily significantly above 1.0. In the 2000s, the relative rate was 1.71. There is no evidence that that the gender gap is decreasing over time.}

 % WAYS TO PIVOT
 % Thank you for the question. /  that's a great question
 % More generally how i've been thinking about issues such as this ...

% Q: Why didn't you look at x variable?
  % A: As you might imagine, these data took years to compile, and clean into 1 compatible data set. I think that any good science starts with thorough, careful description. If I were to explore any other variable and my descriptive analyses, I would have to balance with the reduction in what types of knowledge I could look at, since not all data sets have all independent variables that might be of interest. So, if I selected out some trait, I would lose some of my 500 variables that I worked hard aggregate. But I have invested the time in this because I will be able to work with these data for years to come - including analyzing many other interesting independent variables like X.
 % --> add slide with demonstration of how eg, region or/and political affiliation would reduce # variables


 % Q:Haven’t lots of people studied knowledge and equality?
 % A:  Thank you for raising that question. Indeed at first glance it might seem that my topic has been covered by scholars working in areas like health inequality and educational inequality. However, I would suggest that what my work contributes is really a broad comparative view of all types of knowledge inequality - enabling us to look at different types of knowledge in comparative perspective.


 % How does stereotype threat play into this story? It struck me that many of these domains are associated with these status characteristics, so how might stereotype threat affect whether the respondents get the answer right in the first place?
